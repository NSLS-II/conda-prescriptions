Note that for the time being you need to manually create the connection.yml.
Run the following from a terminal (in unix)

echo "# metadatastore configuration
# installed by nslsii_dev_configuration
# DO NOT EDIT
host: localhost
database: datastore-dev
port: 27017
timezone: US/Eastern
" > ~/.config/metadatastore/connection.yml

Or create a file with the following:

host: localhost
database: datastore-dev
port: 27017
timezone: US/Eastern
